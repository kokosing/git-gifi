However this implementation is much simplier (git stash based). You can push (with **gifi push**) your commit on the queue (into git stash) and then pop (with **git pop**) it from the queue to your workspace.\r\n\r\n###Feature\r\nIt is a simpliified version of [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). It is well suited to the case where you and your team work always on the same branch called *master* (no *develop* branch). For each feature you create a *feature branch* wich then is merged into *master*. Releases are just tagged commits in *master*.\r\n\r\n\tgit feature-start new_feature\r\n\tgit add new_feature.code\r\n\tgit commit  -m 'new feature commit message'\r\n\tgit feature-publish\r\n\t# after code review\r\n\tgit feature-finish\r\n\r\n###Github\r\nTo use github integration you need to authoriize first (obtain an access token):\r\n\r\n\tgit github-authorize\r\n\t\r\nNote that authorization information are stored per repository. Thanks to that it is possible to work with different github providers like github.com or github enterprise. However, if you have multiple repositories on the same github providers then you won't be able to authenticate git-gifi again, as it is already authenticated for different reposotiry but same github provider. In that case you need to go to your github profile settings, copy git-gifi access token and us it in below command:\r\n\r\n\tgit github-configure\r\n\t\r\n##### Pull request\r\nWith **git github-request** you can post a new pull request from current branch. It is required that branch is not 'master' and it is already pushed.\r\nIn order to create a pull request during **git feature-publish**, please do **git feature-configure** first and enable pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###Slack\r\nTo use github integration you need to authenticate first obtain an access token for slack web api and the pass it to:\r\n\r\n\tgit slack-configure\r\n\r\nBy default when you run ``*-configure``` command configuration is stored in local repository. Typically slack configuration does not change between projects, so in order to store it globally (system wide) you can run below command. Thanks to that slack configuration will be reused between git repositories on your system:\r\n\r\n\tgit slack-configure global\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n##### Notify about pull request changes\r\nIf you want to send a notifaction to slack channel about pull request changes you need to enable it by specifying the channel to which you want to send messages.\r\n\r\n\tgit slack-configure\r\n\t\r\nAdditinally, if you want to send notification to particular people on slack like: mike and john, then add below line to your last commit message in pull request:\r\n\r\n\tReviewers: mike, john\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
